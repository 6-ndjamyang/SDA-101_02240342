# Reflection

# Main Concepts Applied:
In this project, I focused on using HTML for the webpage structure and Tailwind CSS for styling. I emphasized responsive layouts with Flexbox and Tailwindâ€™s utility classes, which helped me create a clean, functional design.

# New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
I learned a lot about responsive design and how to make web pages that look great on any device. I also got more comfortable with Tailwind CSS, especially when it came to spacing and alignment, and I picked up some JavaScript skills for dynamic elements like tabs.

# Reflection:
What I Learned
This project taught me the importance of user experience in web design. I realized how crucial it is to organize content logically, making it easy for users to navigate.

# Challenges Faced:
I faced some challenges with layout balance on different screens, initially struggling with spacing and alignment.

# Solution:
To fix this, I adjusted the Tailwind CSS settings and tested my design on various devices. I also had trouble with the tab functionality for the FAQ section. After some research and trial and error, I finally got it to work!
